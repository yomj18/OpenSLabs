3. Chapter 3 of Free Culture 

First and foremost, I think this is an example to think through 
every aspect of your open source project as clearly as possible, and to 
take responsibility for your creation. Jesse was clearly only thinking of
making a search engine that would make anything more accessible, not
to encourage illegal activities. It does reinforce the idea that half the
time in society, the creator is expected to pay rather than the user. 
For example, why didn't the RIAA find who uploaded the music files and
fine them as well? Why do people blame the upbringing of an abnormally 
behaving human on the parents rather than the human? To the RIAA, the fact
that Jesse's search engine would enable piracy was more important than 
penalizing what was already done. 
It also goes to show that you should read the copyright of whatever
software you use. I think this is what programmers should be most careful 
with when looking to contribute/create an open source project.
