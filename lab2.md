1. four criteria for Free Software - read. 


2. It's important to choose a license because there needs to be a legal 
way to ensure that free software remains free. A free software license 
would require that the freedoms would be permanent, and not revokable
or restricted by the developer. 


3. You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license 
because there is no guarantee of your freedoms to use it. If you use it,
and a license is then put in place that does not allow the project to be 
free, then you can be sued (and it would be a legal mess). 


4. The claim is that Gopher failed to follow the open systems model, and
it contributed to its downfall. I somewhat agree with this claim, only 
because I know how much communication goes a long way, and that the more
minds dedicated to thinking about how to improve, the more progress there
eventually will be. 


5. Linux uses the GPL v2 because it allowed them to distribute their 
source code, and also to have it attributed back to them when software 
using (a modification of) their source code is made available. Linux 
stayed with GPL v2 due to a dislike of some of the terms made in v3, 
which prohibited the use of software in digital rights management. 


6. For an example project, GNU GPLv3 was chosen. 

7. I think that LGPL would be best for the common good because it 
applies to libraries, than whole softwares, which would be easier on 
the common good to handle. 
I think that GPL would be best for the developer, mainly because it 
allows you to use the software as long as you keep track of the changes 
made in source files through dates. 
I think that Apache/BSD would be used for business because with both, 
there are a lot of freedom that is given, as well as a patent license 
from the contributors of the code. 


8. MIT License 


9. While I still don't have a project idea, I know I want it to be 
something that could be used/modified by other developers looking
to use the software to suit their own purposes. I know there is only so
much that one mind can do, so by having this license, I can work on it 
and improve on it as much as I want (after having the basics of what it
should be doing down) and then let others use it as is or edit it. I 
don't want something overly complicated, so the MIT license suits my 
purposes.
